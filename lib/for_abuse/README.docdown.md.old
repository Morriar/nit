# `for_abuse` - Service management through the `for` control structure.

[[toc: for_abuse]]

The module is a proof-of-concept to investigate the abuse of
the `for` structure to implement various services.

The idea is that, with a `for`, the service-provider can:

* control the end of the service (thus can finalize things
  like releasing ressources)
* communicate data with the user on each iteration; the used can
  also communicate results to the provider.

## `ForAbuser` - Encapsulation of service in a `for`-compatible interface.
