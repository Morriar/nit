# `deriving` - Automatic derivable implementations of standard basic methods.

[[toc: deriving]]

This module introduce `Derivable` as the main interface to implement (or auto-implement) and
provides additional mixin-interfaces with specific default behavior of standard basic methods based
on the services of this interface.

The name *[[deriving]]* is inspired from the deriving mechanism of Haskell.

This module also introduce a new annotation `auto_derive`. See `Derivable` for details.
