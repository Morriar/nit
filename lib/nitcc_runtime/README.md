# `nitcc_runtime` - Runtime library required by parsers and lexers generated by nitcc

## Features

* `DFAState` - A state in a lexer automaton generated by nitcc
* `LRGoto` - A concrete production in a parser LR automation generated by nitcc
* `LRState` - A state in a parser LR automaton generated by nitcc
* `Lexer` - A abstract lexer engine generated by nitcc
* `NEof` - The special token for the end of stream
* `NError` - A special token used to represent a parser or lexer error
* `NLexerError` - A lexer error as a token for the unexpected characted
* `NParserError` - A parser error linked to a unexpected token
* `NProd` - A production with a specific, named and statically typed children
* `NToken` - A token produced by the lexer and used in a syntactic tree
* `Node` - A node of a syntactic tree
* `Nodes` - A hogeneous sequence of node, used to represent unbounded lists (and + modifier)
* `Parser` - A abstract parser engine generated by nitcc
* `Position` - A position into a input stream
* `TestParser` - All-in-one abstract class to test generated parsers on a given
* `TreePrinterVisitor` - Print a node (using to_s) on a line and recustively each children indented (with two spaces)
* `Visitor` - A abstract visitor on syntactic trees generated by nitcc
