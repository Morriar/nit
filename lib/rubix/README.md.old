# `rubix` - Rubix-cube modelization library

As for now the library supports basic representation of a [Rubix](rubix)-cube
The library is built for speed, most operations cost no allocations to perform.
This does however mean that the library is NOT thread-safe and should be handled
with the appropriate mutual-exclusion mechanisms to avoid memory corruption
or unintended side-effects on a single cube.

The library supports the singmaster notation as a way to perform operations
on a Rubix cube.

No solver is (yet) provided along with the library.

## `rubix::RubixCube` - In-memory representation of a Rubix Cube

Faces are represented in memory as if they were a flattened cube like:

~~~raw
      B B B
      B B B
      B B B
      U U U
      U U U
      U U U
L L L F F F R R R
L L L F F F R R R
L L L F F F R R R
      D D D
      D D D
      D D D
~~~

All the commands detailed in the class respect the Singmaster notation
