# `java` - Supporting services for the FFI with Java and to access Java libraries

This modules relies on `Sys::jvm`, `Sys::jni_env` and
`Sys::create_default_jvm` to get a handle on a JVM. You can adapt the
behavior of the FFI and services in this module by redefing
`Sys::create_default_jvm` and supply your own JVM object. You can manage
multiple java thread by switching the current environment in a redef
of `Sys::jni_env`, and multiple JVM using `Sys::jvm`.

See also, the module `jvm` to control the JVM instances and access JNI functions.
You can use it to further customize the behavior of your code.
