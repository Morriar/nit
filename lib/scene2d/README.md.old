## `Sprite` - The basic atomic living and moving object.

A sprite has a position and a velocity

Properties:

* `angle_to` - Return the angle to target an other sprite
* `bottom` - Y coordinate of bottom.
* `left` - X coordinate of left side.
* `overlaps` - Is self overlaps (or contains) an other sprite
* `right` - X coordinate of right side.
* `set_velocity` - Update of vx and vy toward a given angle and magnitude
* `top` - Y coordinate of top.
* `velocity_angle` - Return the current angle of velocity

## `View` - Abstract view do draw sprites

Concrete views are specific for each back-end.
View can also be used to implements camera and other fun things.

Properties:

* `draw_sprite` - Draw a specific sprite on the view

## Other classes from `scene2d`

* `LiveGroup` - Organizational class to manage groups of sprites and other live objects.
* `LiveObject` - The root class of the living objects (sprites, group of sprites, etc.)
* `Scene` - A state in the game logic
