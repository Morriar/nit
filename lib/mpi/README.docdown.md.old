# `mpi` - Implementation of the Message Passing Interface protocol by wrapping OpenMPI

[[toc: mpi]]

OpenMPI is used only at linking and for it's `mpi.h`. Other implementations
could be used without much modification.

Supports transfer of any valid `Serializable` instances as well as basic
C arrays defined in module `c`. Using C arrays is encouraged when performance
is critical.

Since this module is a thin wrapper around OpenMPI, in case of missing
documentation, you can refer to https://www.open-mpi.org/doc/v1.8/.
