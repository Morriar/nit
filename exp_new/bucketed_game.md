# `bucketed_game` - Game framework with an emphasis on efficient event coordination

Provides basic game logic entities to manage a game where the logic is executed by turns:
`Game`, `GameTurn`, `GameEvent`, `Turnable`.
Also offers a bucket system to plan future events at a known number of turns in the future:
`Bucketable` and the services `act_next` and `act_in`.

Efficiently support large number of entities with rare or sparse actions,
such as a forest with many individual trees growing slowly.
