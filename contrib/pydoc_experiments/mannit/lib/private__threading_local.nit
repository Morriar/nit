# Thread-local objects.
# (Note that this module provides a Python version of the threading.local
# class.  Depending on the version of Python you're using, there may be a
# faster one available.  You should always import the `local` class from
# `threading`.)
# Thread-local objects support the management of thread-local data.
# If you have data that you want to be local to a thread, simply create
# a thread-local object and use its attributes:
# >>> mydata = local()
# >>> mydata.number = 42
# >>> mydata.number
# 42
# You can also access the local-object's dictionary:
# >>> mydata.__dict__
# {'number': 42}
# >>> mydata.__dict__.setdefault('widgets', [])
# []
# >>> mydata.widgets
# []
# What's important about thread-local objects is that their data are
# local to a thread. If we access the data in a different thread:
# >>> log = []
# >>> def f():
# ...     items = mydata.__dict__.items()
# ...     items.sort()
# ...     log.append(items)
# ...     mydata.number = 11
# ...     log.append(mydata.number)
# >>> import threading
# >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
# >>> thread.start()
# >>> thread.join()
# >>> log
# [[], 11]
# we get different data.  Furthermore, changes made in the other thread
# don't affect data seen in this thread:
# >>> mydata.number
# 42
# Of course, values you get from a local object, including a __dict__
# attribute, are for whatever thread was current at the time the
# attribute was read.  For that reason, you generally don't want to save
# these values across threads, as they apply only to the thread they
# came from.
# You can create custom local objects by subclassing the local class:
# >>> class MyLocal(local):
# ...     number = 2
# ...     initialized = False
# ...     def __init__(self, **kw):
# ...         if self.initialized:
# ...             raise SystemError('__init__ called too many times')
# ...         self.initialized = True
# ...         self.__dict__.update(kw)
# ...     def squared(self):
# ...         return self.number ** 2
# This can be useful to support default values, methods and
# initialization.  Note that if you define an __init__ method, it will be
# called each time the local object is used in a separate thread.  This
# is necessary to initialize each thread's dictionary.
# Now if we create a local object:
# >>> mydata = MyLocal(color='red')
# Now we have a default number:
# >>> mydata.number
# 2
# an initial color:
# >>> mydata.color
# 'red'
# >>> del mydata.color
# And a method that operates on the data:
# >>> mydata.squared()
# 4
# As before, we can access the data in a separate thread:
# >>> log = []
# >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
# >>> thread.start()
# >>> thread.join()
# >>> log
# [[('color', 'red'), ('initialized', True)], 11]
# without affecting this thread's data:
# >>> mydata.number
# 2
# >>> mydata.color
# Traceback (most recent call last):
# ...
# AttributeError: 'MyLocal' object has no attribute 'color'
# Note that subclasses can define slots, but they are not thread
# local. They are shared across threads:
# >>> class MyLocal(local):
# ...     __slots__ = 'number'
# >>> mydata = MyLocal()
# >>> mydata.number = 42
# >>> mydata.color = 'red'
# So, the separate thread:
# >>> thread = threading.Thread(target=f)
# >>> thread.start()
# >>> thread.join()
# affects what we see:
# >>> mydata.number
# 11
# >>> del mydata
