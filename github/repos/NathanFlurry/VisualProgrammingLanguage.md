  <i>Swift Visual Programming Language</i>
</p>

This project aims to proof the node-based visual programming language that assembles executable Swift code and can be written using an Apple Pencil or touch entirely.

See `wwdc-submission` branch for the original files submitted for my WWDC 2018 scholarship.

## Discussion

This is an early prototype of visual programming language built for touch. It is incredibly inefficient to write programs in this prototype, but I intend to change.

As always, feedback and pull requests are more than welcome.

## Future Goals

I hope to continue the development this summer. Hold tight!
